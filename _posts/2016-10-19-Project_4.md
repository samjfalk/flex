<b>Problem Statement</b>

"You're working as a data scientist for a contracting firm that's rapidly expanding. Now that they have their most valuable employee (you!), they need to leverage data to win more contracts. Your firm offers technology and scientific solutions and wants to be competitive in the hiring market. Your principal thinks the best way to gauge salary amounts is to take a look at what industry factors influence the pay scale for these professionals."

<b>Data Scraping and Cleaning</b>

To explore data science salaries, the team began with scraping Indeed.com job postings to gather information about Title, State, City and Company. This scraper was a modified version of another scraper provided by a teammate. We scraped over 10,000 job postings from 14 major tech cities across the US. The data was cleaned to make it easier to analyze. Some aspects of the cleaning included removing job postings without a salary listed, simplify job title listings to a set number of categories and converted all pay units to a yearly amount. In the case of the last aspect of cleaning, we based our coversion to a 50 week year, as that tends to be the average.  

<b> Model Overview</b>

Based upon the data we built a model that could predict whether a salary would be above or below the mean. Building a model that predicted exact amounts would not be very useful as jobs vary so much depending upon the person who is hired.
